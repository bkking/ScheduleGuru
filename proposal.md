### Project Description
Our Schedule Planning Website, the Schedule Guru,
is a site for students to search for their classes by either
school or subject depending on the term. In order
to work to its fullest potential the Schedule Guru has
many different front end design features so that
it is easy to navigate. Overall, it is meant to help 
Michigan students find new classes in the most 
comfortable format possible.
